# Beats Newspaper
This is an app I built to simulate a newspaper called Beats Newspaper.  On the front
page I experimented with css3 animations which was especially fun.  The main purpose
of this project was to develop an understanding of Angular and Angular-ui.  
## Setup Instructions:

Clone repository
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
